let text1 = `“Little tyke,”“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard — ”“ — yes, their son, Harry — ”“Sorry,”“Don’t be sorry, my dear sir,
for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-
Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like
yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy
day!”“Shoo!”“Won’t!”“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported
that the nation’s owls have been behaving very
unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at
night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have
been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in
every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to
explain why the owls have suddenly changed their
sleeping pattern.”“Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim
McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more
showers of owls tonight, Jim?”“Well, Ted,”“I don’t know about
that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting
oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire,
and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that
instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a
downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have
been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until
next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night
tonight.”“Er
— Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister
lately, have you?”“No,”“Why?”“Funny stuff on the news,”“Owls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of
funny-looking people in town today ...”“So?”“Well, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to
do with ... you know ... her crowd.”“Potter.”“Their son —
he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?”“I suppose so,”“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?”“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.”“Oh, yes,”“Yes, I quite agree.”“I should have
known.”“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”“How did you know it was me?”“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all
day,”“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I
must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my
way here.”“Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,”“You’d think they’d be a bit more careful,
but no — even the Muggles have noticed something’s
going on. It was on their news.”“I
heard it. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars. ... Well,
they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to
notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll
bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much
sense.”“You can’t blame them,”“We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven
years.”“I know that,”“But that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are
being downright careless, out on the streets in broad





daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes,
swapping rumors.”“A fine
thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who
seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found
out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,
Dumbledore?”“It certainly seems so,”“We have
much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon
drop?”“A what?”“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m
rather fond of.”“No, thank you,”“As I say, even if You-Know-Who has
gone — ”“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like
yourself can call him by his name? All this You-
Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been
trying to persuade people to call him by his proper
name: Voldemort.”“It all gets so confusing if we
keep saying You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any
reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.”“I know you haven’t,”“But you’re
different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-
Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.”“You flatter me,”“Voldemort
had powers I will never have.”“Only because you’re too — well — noble to use
them.”“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since
Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.”“The owls are nothing next to
the rumors that are flying around. You know what
everyone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared?

About what finally stopped him?”“everyone”“What they’re saying,”“is that last
night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He
went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and
James Potter are — are — that they’re — dead.”“Lily and James ... I can’t believe it ... I didn’t want to
believe it ... Oh, Albus ...”“I know ... I know ...”“That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the
Potters’ son, Harry. But — he couldn’t. He couldn’t
kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but
they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter,
Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why
he’s gone.”“It’s — it’s true?”“After
all he’s done ... all the people he’s killed ... he couldn’t
kill a little boy? It’s just astounding ... of all the
things to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven
did Harry survive?”“We can only guess,”“We may
never know.”“Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be
here, by the way?”“Yes,”“And I don’t
suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all
places?”“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle.
They’re the only family he has left now.”“You don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who
live here?”“Dumbledore — you
can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t
find two people who are less like us. And they’ve got
this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way
up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter
come and live here!”“It’s the best place for him,”“His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything
to him when he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.”“A letter?”“Really, Dumbledore,
you think you can explain all this in a letter? These
people will never understand him! He’ll be famous —
a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was
known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will
be books written about Harry — every child in our
world will know his name!”“Exactly,”“It would be
enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can
walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even
remember! Can’t you see how much better off he’ll be,
growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take
it?”“Yes — yes, you’re
right, of course. But how is the boy getting here,
Dumbledore?”“Hagrid’s bringing him.”“You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with
something as important as this?”“I would trust Hagrid with my life,”“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,”“but you can’t
pretend he’s not careless. He does tend to — what
was that?”“Hagrid,”“At
last. And where did you get that motorcycle?”“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,”“Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him,
sir.”“No problems, were there?”“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him
out all right before the Muggles started swarmin’
around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.”“Is that where — ?”“Yes,”“Hell have that scar forever.”“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?”“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy.

I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect
map of the London Underground. Well — give him
here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.”“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?”“Shhh!”“you’ll wake the
Muggles!”“S-s-sorry,”“But I c-c-
can’t stand it — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little
Harry off ter live with Muggles — ”“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself,
Hagrid, or we’ll be found,”“Well,”“that’s that. We’ve no
business staying here. We may as well go and join the
celebrations.”“Yeah,”“I’d best
get this bike away. G ’night, Professor McGonagall —
Professor Dumbledore, sir.”“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,”“Good luck, Harry,”“To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”“Up! Get up! Now!”“Up!”“Are you up yet?”“Nearly,”“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the
bacon. And don’t you dare let it burn, I want
everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.”“What did you say?”“Nothing, nothing ...”“In the car crash when your parents died,”“And don’t ask questions.”“Comb your hair!”“Thirty-six,”“That’s two less than last year.”“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present,
see, it’s here under this big one from Mommy and
Daddy.”“All right, thirty-seven then,”“And we’ll buy you another two
presents while we’re out today. How’s that, popkin?
Two more presents. Is that all right?”“So I’ll have thirty ...
thirty ...”“Thirty-nine, sweetums,”“Oh.”“All right then.”“Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his
father. ’Atta boy, Dudley!”“Bad news, Vernon,”“Mrs. Figg’s broken her
leg. She can’t take him.”“Now what?”“We could phone Marge,”“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.”“What about what’s-her-name, your friend —
Yvonne?”“On vacation in Majorca,”“You could just leave me here,”“And come back and find the house in ruins?”“I won’t blow up the house,”“I suppose we could take him to the zoo,”“... and leave him in the car. ...”“That cars new, he’s not sitting in it alone. ...”“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him
spoil your special day!”“I ... don’t ... want ... him ... t-t-to come!”“He always sp-
spoils everything!”“Oh, good Lord,
they’re here!”“I’m warning you,”“I’m warning you
now, boy — any funny business, anything at all —
and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until
Christmas.”“honestly







But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did.



The problem was, strange things often happened
around Harry and it was just no good telling the
Dursleys he didn’t make them happen.

Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from
the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all,
had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair
so short he was almost bald except for his bangs,
which she left “to hide that horrible scar.”“... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,”“I had a dream about a motorcycle,”“It was flying.”“MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!”“I know they don’t,”“It was only a dream.”“Make it move,”“Do it again,”“This is boring,”“I get that all the time.”“I know,”“It must be
really annoying.”“Where do you come from, anyway?”“Was it nice there?”“Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?”“DUDLEY!
MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE!
YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”“Out of the way, you,”“Brazil, here I come.
... Thanksss, amigo.”“But the glass,”“where did the glass
go?”“Harry
was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?”“Go —
cupboard — stay — no meals,”“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day
at Stonewall,”“Want to come upstairs
and practice?”“No, thanks,”“The poor toilet’s never had
anything as horrible as your head down it — it might
be sick.”“What’s this?”“Your new school uniform,”“Oh,”“I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.”“Don’t be stupid,”“I’m dyeing
some of Dudley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just
like everyone else’s when I’ve finished.”“Get the mail, Dudley,”“Make Harry get it.”“Get the mail, Harry.”“Make Dudley get it.”“Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.”“Hurry up, boy!”“What are you doing, checking for letter
bombs?”“Marge’s ill,”“Ate a funny
whelk ...”“Dad!”“Dad, Harry’s got
something!”“That’s mine”“Who’d be writing to you?”“P-P-Petunia!”“Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!”“I want to read that letter,”“I want to read it,”“as it’s mine.”“Get out, both of you,”“I WANT MY LETTER!”“Let me see it!”“OUT!”“Vernon,”“look at the address — how could they possibly
know where he sleeps? You don’t think they’re
watching the house?”“Watching — spying — might be following us,”“But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write
back? Tell them we don’t want — ”“No,”“No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t
get an answer. ... Yes, that’s best ... we won’t do
anything. ...”“But — ”“I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we
swear when we took him in we’d stamp out that
dangerous nonsense?”“Where’s my letter?”“Who’s
writing to me?”“No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,”“I have burned it.”“It was not a mistake,”“it had my
cupboard on it.”“SILENCE!”“Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt
and I have been thinking ... you’re really getting a bit
big for it . . . we think it might be nice if you moved
into Dudley’s second bedroom.”“Why?”“Don’t ask questions!”“Take this
stuff upstairs, now.”“I don’t want him in there ... I need
that room ... make him get out. ...”“There’s another one! ‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest
Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive — ’ ”“Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,”“Dudley — go — just go.”“AAAAARRRGH ! ”“I want — ”“See,”“if they can’t deliver them they’ll
just give up.”“I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.”“Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways,
Petunia, they’re not like you and me,”“Tiptoe
Through the Tulips”“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?”“No post on Sundays,”“no
damn letters today — ”“Out! OUT!”“That does it,”“I want you all back here in five
minutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack
some clothes. No arguments!”“Shake ’em off ... shake ’em off,”“ ’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I
got about an ’undred of these at the front desk.”“I’ll take them,”“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?”“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?”“It’s Monday,”“The Great
Humberto’s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with
a television.”“Found the perfect place!”“Come on!

Everyone out!”“Storm forecast for tonight!”“And this
gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!”“I’ve already got us some rations,”“so all aboard!”“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?”“Where’s the cannon?”“Who’s there?”“I warn you — I’m armed!”“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not
been an easy journey. ...”“Budge up, yeh great lump,”“An’ here’s Harry!”“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,”“Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer
mom’s eyes.”“I demand that you leave at once, sir!”“You
are breaking and entering!”“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,”“Anyway — Harry,”“a very happy birthday to yeh. Got
summat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at some
point, but it’ll taste all right.”“Who are you?”“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid,
Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.”“What about that tea then, eh?”“I’d not say no ter summat stronger if
yeh’ve got it, mind.”“Don’t
touch anything he gives you, Dudley.”“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’
anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.”“I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.”“Call me Hagrid,”“everyone does. An’ like I
told yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll
know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.”“Er — no,”“Sorry,”“Sorry?”“It’s





them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t gettin’
yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even
know abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh
never wonder where yer parents learned it all?”“All what?”“ALL WHAT?”“Now wait jus’ one
second!”“Do you mean ter tell me,”“that this boy — this boy! — knows nothin’ abou’ —
about ANYTHING?”“I know some things,”“I can, you know, do
math and stuff.”“About
our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’
world.”“What world?”“DURSLEY!”“Mimblewimble.”“But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,”“I mean, they’re famous. You’re famous.”“What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were
they?”“Yeh don’ know ... yeh don’ know ...”“Yeh don’ know what yeh are?”“Stop!”“Stop right there, sir! I forbid
you to tell the boy anything!”“You never told him? Never told him what was in the
letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw
Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it from
him all these years?”“Kept what from me?”“STOP! I FORBID YOU!”“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,”“Harry — yer a wizard.”“I’m a what?”“A wizard, o’ course,”“an’
a thumpin’ good’un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained
up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else
would yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read
yer letter.”“What does it mean, they
await my owl?”“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,”“Where was I?”“He’s not going,”“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,”“A what?”“A Muggle,”“it’s what we call nonmagic
folk like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a
family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.”“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to
that rubbish,”“swore we’d stamp
it out of him! Wizard indeed!”“You knew?”“You knew I’m a — a
wizard?”“Knew!”“Knew Of
course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted
sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just
like that and disappeared off to that — that school —
and came home every vacation with her pockets full
of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the
only one who saw her for what she was — a freak!

But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this
and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in
the family!”“Then she met that Potter at school and they left and
got married and had you, and of course I knew you’d
be just the same, just as strange, just as — as —
abnormal — and then, if you please, she went and got
herself blown up and we got landed with you!”“Blown up? You told me they died in a
car crash!”“CAR CRASH!”“How
could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter? It’s an
outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own
story when every kid in our world knows his name!”“But why? What happened?”“I never expected this,”“I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there
might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh
didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right
person ter tell yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t
go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.”“Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh —
mind, I can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry,
parts of it. ...”“It begins, I suppose, with — with a
person called — but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his
name, everyone in our world knows — ”“Who?”“Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No
one does.”“Why not?”“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared.
Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard
who went ... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse.
Worse than worse. His name was ...”“Could you write it down?”“Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort.”“Don’ make me say it again. Anyway, this
— this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started
lookin’ fer followers. Got ’em, too — some were afraid,
some just wanted a bit o’ his power, ’cause he was
gettin’ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry.
Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly
with strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things
happened. He was takin’ over. ’Course, some stood up
to him — an’ he killed ’em. Horribly. One o’ the only
safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s
the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare
try takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway.

“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’
wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hogwarts
in their day! Suppose the myst’ry is why You-Know-
Who never tried to get ’em on his side before . . .
probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter
want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side.

“Maybe he thought he could persuade ’em ... maybe
he just wanted ’em outta the way. All anyone knows
is, he turned up in the village where you was all
living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a
year old. He came ter yer house an’ — an’ — ”“Sorry,”“But it’s that sad — knew yer mum
an’ dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find — anyway



“You-Know-Who killed ’em. An’ then — an’ this is the
real myst’ry of the thing — he tried to kill you, too.
Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or
maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do
it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer
forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what yeh
get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took
care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it
didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry.
No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ’em, no one
except you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches
an’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones,
the Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you
lived.”“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on
Dumbledore’s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot ...”“Load of old tosh,”“Now, you listen here, boy,”“I accept
there’s something strange about you, probably





nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and as
for all this about your parents, well, they were
weirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off
without them in my opinion — asked for all they got,
getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just
what I expected, always knew they’d come to a sticky
end — ”“I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one
more word ...”“That’s better,”“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-
Know-Who?”“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same
night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more
famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see ... he was
gettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d he go?

“Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno
if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say
he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’
believe it. People who was on his side came back ter







ours. Some of ’em came outta kinda trances. Don’
reckon they could’ve done if he was cornin’ back.

“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but
lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. ’Cause
somethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There was
somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on —
/ dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’
about you stumped him, all right.”“Hagrid,”“I think you must have
made a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.”“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when
you was scared or angry?”“See?”“Harry Potter, not a wizard — you
wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.”“Haven’t I told you he’s not going?”“He’s
going to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve
read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish —
spell books and wands and — ”“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop
him,”“Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s
son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name’s been
down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest
school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven
years there and he won’t know himself. He’ll be with
youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be
under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had,
Albus Dumbled — ”“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD
FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!”“NEVER — ”“— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE
— IN — FRONT — OF — ME!”“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,”“but it
didn’t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig,
but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there
wasn’t much left ter do.”“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at
Hogwarts,”“I’m — er — not supposed ter do
magic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a bit ter
follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’
the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job — ”“Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?”“Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er —
got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year.
They snapped me wand in half an’ everything. But
Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great
man, Dumbledore.”“Why were you expelled?”“It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,”“Gotta get up ter town, get all yer
books an’ that.”“You can kip under that,”“Don’ mind if it
wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o’ dormice in
one o’ the pockets.”“It was a dream,”“I dreamed a
giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a
school for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be at
home in my cupboard.”“All right,”“I’m getting up.”“Don’t do that.”“Hagrid!”“There’s an owl — ”“Pay him,”“What?”“He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the
pockets.”“Give him five Knuts,”“Knuts?”“The little bronze ones.”“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter
London an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.”“Urn — Hagrid?”“Mm?”“I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle
Vernon last night ... he won’t pay for me to go and
learn magic.”“Don’t worry about that,”“D’yeh think yer parents
didn’t leave yeh anything?”“But if their house was destroyed — ”“They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah,
first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a
sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no
teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.”“Wizards have banks?”“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.”“Goblins?”“Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh
that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the
safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter
keep safe — ’cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’
fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore.
Hogwarts business.”“He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him.
Fetchin’ you — gettin’ things from Gringotts — knows
he can trust me, see.

“Got everythin’? Come on, then.”“How did you get here?”“Flew,”“Flew?”“Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter
use magic now I’ve got yeh.”“Seems a shame ter row, though,”“If I was ter — er
— speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not
mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?”“Of course not,”“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?”“Spells — enchantments,”“They say there’s dragons
guardin’ the high-security vaults. And then yeh gotta
find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under
London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die
of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter
get yer hands on summat.”“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,”“There’s a Ministry of Magic?”“ ’Course,”“They wanted Dumbledore fer
Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so
old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there
was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every
morning, askin’ fer advice.”“But what does a Ministry of Magic do?”“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles
that there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the
country.”“Why?”“Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone ’d be wantin’ magic
solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left
alone.”“See
that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?”“Hagrid,”“did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?”“Well, so they say,”“Crikey, I’d like a
dragon.”“You’d like one?”“Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.”“Muggle money,”“Still got yer letter, Harry?”“Good,”“There’s a list there of everything
yeh need.”“Can we buy all this in London?”“If yeh know where to go,”“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without
magic,”“This is it,”“the Leaky
Cauldron. It’s a famous place.”“The usual,
Hagrid?”“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,”“Good Lord,”“is
this — can this be — ?”“Bless my soul,”“Harry
Potter ... what an honor.”“Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.”“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting
you at last.”“So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.”“Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a
flutter.”“Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the
name, Dedalus Diggle.”“I’ve seen you before!”“You bowed to me
once in a shop.”“He remembers!”“Did you hear that? He
remembers me!”“Professor Quirrell!”“Harry, Professor
Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.”“P-P-Potter,”“c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to
meet you.”“What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,”“N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?”“You’ll be g-getting all your
equipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-
book on vampires, m-myself.”“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even
Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind
you, he’s usually tremblin’.”“Is he always that nervous?”“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine
while he was studyin’ outta books but then he took a
year off ter get some firsthand experience. ... They say
he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a
nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same
since. Scared of the students, scared of his own
subject — now, where’s me umbrella?”“Three up ... two across ...”“Right,
stand back, Harry.”“Welcome,”“to Diagon Alley.”“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,”“but we
gotta get yer money first.”“Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad.”“Look,”“the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest
ever — ”“Gringotts,”“Yeah, that’s a goblin,”“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,”“Morning,”“We’ve come
ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.”“You have his key, sir?”“Got it here somewhere,”“Got it,”“That seems to be in order.”“An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor
Dumbledore,”“It’s about the You-Know-What in vault
seven hundred and thirteen.”“Very well,”“I will
have someone take you down to both vaults.
Griphook!”“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred
and thirteen?”“Can’t tell yeh that,”“Very
secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me.
More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.”“I never know,”“what’s the difference between a
stalagmite and a stalactite?”“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,”“An’ don’
ask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be
sick.”“All yours,”“The gold ones are Galleons,”“Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine
Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should
be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest
safe for yeh.”“Vault seven
hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go
more slowly?”“One speed only,”“Stand back,”“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be
sucked through the door and trapped in there,”“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?”“About once every ten years,”“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to
me on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth
shut,”“Might as well get yer uniform,”“Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a
pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them
Gringotts carts.”“Hogwarts, dear?”“Got the lot here — another young man being
fitted up just now, in fact.”“Hello,”“Hogwarts, too?”“Yes,”“My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s
up the street looking at wands,”“Then I’m going to drag them
off to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years
can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully father into
getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.”“Have you got your own broom?”“No,”“Play Quidditch at all?”“No,”“ I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to
play for my House, and I must say, I agree. Know
what House you 11 be in yet?”“No,”“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do
they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family
have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d
leave, wouldn’t you?”“Mmm,”“I say, look at that man!”“That’s Hagrid,”“He works at Hogwarts.”“Oh,”“I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of
servant, isn’t he?”“He’s the gamekeeper,”“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a
hut on the school grounds and every now and then he
gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire
to his bed.”“I think he’s brilliant,”“Do you?”“Why is he
with you? Where are your parents?”“They’re dead,”“Oh, sorry,”“But they were our kind, weren’t they?”“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you
mean.”“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in,
do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been
brought up to know our ways. Some of them have
never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter,
imagine. I think they should keep it in the old
wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?”“That’s you done, my dear,”“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,”“What’s up?”“Nothing,”“Hagrid, what’s
Quidditch?”“Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know —
not knowin’ about Quidditch!”“Don’t make me feel worse,”“ — and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t
even be allowed in — ”“Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh
were — he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his
parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what everyone in
the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh.
Anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best
I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a
long line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what
she had fer a sister!”“So what is Quidditch?”“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in
the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch —
played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four
balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.”“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”“School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says
Hufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but — ”“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,”“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,”“There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad
who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.”“Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?”“Years an’ years ago,”“I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.”“I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter
use magic in the Muggle world except in very special
circumstances,”“An’ anyway, yeh
couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot
more study before yeh get ter that level.”“It says pewter on yer list”“Just yer wand left — oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got
yeh a birthday present.”“You don’t have to — ”“I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer
animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years
ago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’ like cats, they
make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want
owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’
everythin’.”“Don’ mention it,”“Don’ expect
you’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just
Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands,
Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.”“Good afternoon,”“Hello,”“Ah yes,”“Yes, yes. I thought I’d be
seeing you soon. Harry Potter.”“You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only yesterday
she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten
and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow.
Nice wand for charm work.”“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany
wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and
excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father
favored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the
wizard, of course.”“And that’s where ...”“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,”“Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful
wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands ... well,
if I’d known what that wand was going out into the
world to do. ...”“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.

... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”“It was, sir, yes,”“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it
in half when you got expelled?”“Er — yes, they did, yes,”“I’ve still got the pieces, though,”“But you don’t use them?”“Oh, no, sir,”“Hmmm,”“Well, now — Mr. Potter. Let me see.”“Which is your wand arm?”“Er — well, I’m right-handed,”“Hold out your arm. That’s it.”“Every Ollivander wand has a core
of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use
unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the
heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are
the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or
phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will
never get such good results with another wizard’s
wand.”“That will do,”“Right then, Mr.
Potter. Try this one. Beech-wood and dragon
heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take
it and give it a wave.”“Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite
whippy. Try — ”“No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a
half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.”“Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, well find the
perfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now —
yes, why not — unusual combination — holly and
phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.”“Oh,
bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well ...
how curious ... how very curious ...”“Curious . . . curious



“Sorry,”“but what’s curious?”“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter.
Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix
whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another
feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed
that you should be destined for this wand when its
brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.”“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed
how these things happen. The wand chooses the
wizard, remember. ... I think we must expect great
things from you, Mr. Potter. ... After all, He-Who-
Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes,
but great.”“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,”“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,”“Everyone thinks I’m special,”“All
those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor





Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander ... but I don’t know anything
about magic at all. How can they expect great things?
I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m
famous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-,
sorry — I mean, the night my parents died.”“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough.
Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll
be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve
been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll
have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do,
’smatter of fact.”“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,”“First o’ September
— King’s Cross — it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems
with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll
know where to find me. ... See yeh soon, Harry.”“Er — Uncle Vernon?”“Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to
go to Hogwarts.”“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?”“Thank you.”“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train.
Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?”“Where is this school, anyway?”“I don’t know,”“I just take the train from platform nine and three-
quarters at eleven o’clock,”“Platform what?”“Nine and three-quarters.”“Don’t talk rubbish,”“There is no
platform nine and three-quarters.”“It’s on my ticket.”“Barking,”“howling mad, the lot of
them. You 11 see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take
you to King’s Cross. We’re going up to London
tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.”“Why are you going to London?”“Taking Dudley to the hospital,”“Got to have that ruddy tail removed before
he goes to Smeltings.”“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform
ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the
middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do
they?”“Have a good term,”“ — packed with Muggles, of course — ”“Now, what’s the platform number?”“Nine and three-quarters!”“Mom, can’t I go



“You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right,
Percy, you go first.”“Fred, you next,”“I’m not Fred, I’m George,”“Honestly,
woman, you call yourself our mother? Can’t you tell
I’m George?”“Sorry, George, dear.”“Only joking, I am Fred,”“Excuse me,”“Hello, dear,”“First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s
new, too.”“Yes,”“The thing is — the thing is, I don’t
know how to — ”“How to get onto the platform?”“Not to worry,”“All you have to do is walk
straight at the barrier between platforms nine and
ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into
it, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if
you’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.”“Er — okay,”“Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.”“Oh, Neville,”“Give us a look, Lee, go on.”“Want a hand?”“Yes, please,”“Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!”“Thanks,”“What’s that?”“Blimey,”“Are you — ?”“He is,”“Aren’t you?”“What?”“ Harry Potter,”“Oh, him,”“I mean, yes, I am.”“Fred? George? Are you there?”“Coming, Mom.”“Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.”“Mom — geroff.”“Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?”“Shut up,”“Where’s Percy?”“He’s coming now.”“Can’t stay long, Mother,”“I’m up front, the
prefects have got two compartments to themselves — ”“Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?”“You should have said
something, we had no idea.”“Hang on, I think I remember him saying something
about it,”“Once — ”“Or twice — ”“A minute — ”“All summer — ”“Oh, shut up,”“How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?”“Because he’s a prefect,”“All
right, dear, well, have a good term — send me an owl
when you get there.”“Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I
get one more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up
a toilet or — ”“Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.”“Great idea though, thanks, Mom.”“It’s not funny. And look after Ron.”“Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.”“Shut up,”“Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on
the train?”“You know that black-haired boy who was near us in
the station? Know who he is?”“Who?”“ Harry Potted”“Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom,
oh please. ...”“You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy
isn’t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really,
Fred? How do you know?”“Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there — like
lightning.”“Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He
was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the
platform.”“Never mind that, do you think he remembers what
You-Know-Who looks like?”“I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As
though he needs reminding of that on his first day at
school.”“All right, keep your hair on.”“Hurry up!”“Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.”“Well send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.”“ Georg e”“Only joking, Mom.”“Anyone sitting there?”“Everywhere else is full.”“Hey, Ron.”“Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train —

Lee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.”“Right,”“Harry,”“did we introduce
ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron,
our brother. See you later, then.”“Bye,”“Are you really Harry Potter?”“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and
George’s jokes,”“And have you really got —
you know ...”“So that’s where You-Know-Who — ?”“Yes,”“but I can’t remember it.”“Nothing?”“Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing
else.”“Wow,”“Are all your family wizards?”“Er — yes, I think so,”“I think Mom’s got a
second cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk
about him.”“So you must know loads of magic already.”“I heard you went to live with Muggles,”“What are they like?”“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle
and cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard
brothers.”“Five,”“I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts.
You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and
Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and
Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a
prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they
still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re
really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the
others, but if I do, it’s no big deal, because they did it
first. You never get anything new, either, with five






brothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand,
and Percy’s old rat.”“His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever
wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being
made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got
Scabbers instead.”“... and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything
about being a wizard or about my parents or
Voldemort — ”“What?”“ You said You-Know-Who’s name”“I’d have thought you,
of all people — ”“I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the
name,”“I just never knew you shouldn’t.
See what I mean? I’ve got loads to learn. ... I bet,”“I bet I’m the worst in
the class.”“You won’t be. There’s loads of people who come from
Muggle families and they learn quick enough.”“Anything off the cart,
dears?”“Hungry, are you?”“Starving,”“She always forgets I don’t
like corned beef.”“Swap you for one of these,”“Go on — ”“You don’t want this, it’s all dry,”“She
hasn’t got much time,”“you know,
with five of us.”“Go on, have a pasty,”“What are these?”“They’re not really frogs, are
they?”“No,”“But see what the card is. I’m missing
Agrippa.”“What?”“Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs
have cards inside them, you know, to collect —
famous witches and wizards. I’ve got about five
hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.”“So this is Dumbledore!”“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!”“Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks



Harry turned over his card and read:

ALBUS DUMBLEDORE

CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS

Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern
times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his
defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the
discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his
work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel.
Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten
pin bowling.

Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his
astonishment, that Dumbledore ’s face had
disappeared.

“He’s gone!”“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,”“He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again
and I’ve got about six of her ... do you want it? You
can start collecting.”“Help yourself,”“But in, you know, the
Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.”“Do they? What, they don’t move at all?”“Weird).”“You want to be careful with those,”“When they say every flavor, they mean every
flavor — you know, you get all the ordinary ones like
chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then
you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George
reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.”“Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.”“Sorry,”“but have you seen a toad at all?”“I’ve lost
him! He keeps getting away from me!”“Hell turn up,”“Yes,”“Well, if you see him ...”“Don’t know why he’s so bothered,”“If I’d
brought a toad I’d lose it as quick as I could. Mind
you, I brought Scabbers, so I can’t talk.”“He might have died and you wouldn’t know the
difference,”“I tried to turn him
yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but
the spell didn’t work. I’ll show you, look ...”“Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway — ”“Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,”“We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,”“Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.”“Er — all right.”“ Sunshine , daisies, butter mellow,

Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.”“Are you sure that’s a real spell?”“Well,
it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells
just for practice and it’s all worked for me. Nobody in
my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise
when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of
course, I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft
there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books
by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I’m
Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?”“I’m Ron Weasley,”“Harry Potter,”“Are you really?”“I know all about
you, of course — I got a few extra books for
background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical
History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and
Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.”“Am I?”“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out
everything I could if it was me,”“Do
either of you know what House you’ll be in? I’ve been
asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds
by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it,
but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad. ...
Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad.

You two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll
be there soon.”“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,”“Stupid
spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a
dud.”“What House are your brothers in?”“Gryffindor,”“Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t
know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t suppose
Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put
me in Slytherin.”“That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was
in?”“Yeah,”“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are
a bit lighter,”“So what do your oldest brothers do now that
they’ve left, anyway?”“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in
Africa doing something for Gringotts,”“Did
you hear about Gringotts? It’s been all over the Daily
Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the
Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security
vault.”“Really? What happened to them?”“Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t
been caught. My dad says it must’ve been a powerful
Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don’t
think they took anything, that’s what’s odd. ’Course,
everyone gets scared when something like this
happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.”“Voldemort”“What’s your Quidditch team?”“Er — I don’t know any,”“What!”“Oh, you wait, it’s
the best game in the world — ”“Is it true?”“They’re saying all down the train
that Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is
it?”“Yes,”“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,”“And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.”“Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who
you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red
hair, freckles, and more children than they can
afford.”“You’ll soon find out some
wizarding families are much better than others,

Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the
wrong sort. I can help you there.”“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself,
thanks,”“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,”“Unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as
your parents. They didn’t know what was good for
them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the
Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.”“Say that again,”“Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?”“Unless you get out now,”“But we don’t feel like leaving, do we, boys? We’ve
eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.”“What has been going on?”“I think he’s been knocked out,”“No — I don’t believe it
— he’s gone back to sleep.”“You’ve met Malfoy before?”“I’ve heard of his family,”“They were
some of the first to come back to our side after You-
Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been bewitched.
My dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father
didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.”“Can we help you with
something?”“You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve
just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he
says we’re nearly there. You haven’t been fighting,
have you? You’ll be in trouble before we even get
there!”“Scabbers has been fighting, not us,”“Would you mind leaving while we
change?”“All right — I only came in here because people
outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and
down the corridors,”“And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you
know?”“We will be reaching
Hogwarts in five minutes’ time. Please leave your
luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school
separately.”“Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there,
Harry?”`
let text2 = `“C’mon, follow me — any more firs’ years? Mind yer
step, now! Firs’ years follow me!”“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,”“jus’ round this bend here.”“Oooooh!”“No more’n four to a boat!”“Everyone in?”“Right then — FORWARD!”“Heads down!”“Oy, you there! Is this your toad?”“Trevor!”“Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?”“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,”“Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.”“Welcome to Hogwarts,”“The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but
before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will
be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very
important ceremony because, while you are here,
your House will be something like your family within
Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free
time in your House common room.

“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff,
Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own
noble history and each has produced outstanding
witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your
triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-
breaking will lose House points. At the end of the
year, the House with the most points is awarded the
House cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a
credit to whichever House becomes yours.

“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few
minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest
you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”“I shall return when we are ready for you,”“Please wait quietly.”“How exactly do they sort us into Houses?”“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but
I think he was joking.”“What the — ?”“Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give
him a second chance — ”“My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the
chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and






you know, he’s not really even a ghost — I say, what
are you all doing here?”“New students!”“About to be Sorted, I suppose?”“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!”“My old
House, you know.”“Move along now,”“The Sorting
Ceremony’s about to start.”“Now, form a line,”“and follow me.”“It’s bewitched to look like the sky
outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.”“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty,

But don’t judge on what you see,

I’ll eat myself if you can find

A smarter hat than me.

You can keep your bowlers black,








Your top hats sleek and tall,

For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
And I can cap them all.

There’s nothing hidden in your head
The Sorting Hat can’t see,

So try me on and I will tell you
Where you ought to be.

You might belong in Gryffindor,

Where dwell the brave at heart,

Their daring, nerve, and chivalry
Set Gryffindors apart;

You might belong in Hufflepuff,

Where they are just and loyal,

Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
And unafraid of toil;

Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,

If you’ve a ready mind,

Where those of wit and learning,

Will always find their kind;

Or perhaps in Slytherin






You’ll make your real friends,

Those cunning folk use any means
To achieve their ends.

So put me on! Don’t be afraid l
And don’t get in a flap
You’re in safe hands (though I have none)

For I’m a Thinking Cap”“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!”“I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling
a troll.”“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and
sit on the stool to be sorted,”“Abbott,

difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind
either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a
nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. ...
So where shall I put you?”“Not Slytherin, eh?”“Are you
sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in
your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to
greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re
sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!”“We got Potter! We got
Potter!”“Thomas, Dean,”“Turpin, Lisa,”“GRYFFINDOR!”“Well done, Ron, excellent,”“Zabini, Blaise,”“Welcome!”“Welcome to a new year at
Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like
to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit!

Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!

“Thank you!”“Is he — a bit mad?”“Mad?”“He’s a genius! Best wizard
in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes,
Harry?”“That does look good,”“Can’t you — ?”“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,”“I don’t need to, of course, but one does
miss it. I don’t think I’ve introduced myself? Sir
Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service.
Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.”“I know who you are!”“My
brothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless
Nick!”“I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy
— ”“Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?”“Like this,”“So — new
Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the
House Championship this year? Gryffindors have
never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have
got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s
becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin
ghost.”“How did he get covered in blood?”“I’ve never asked,”“I’m half-and-half,”“Me dad’s a Muggle.
Mom didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til after they
were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.”“What about you, Neville?”“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,”“but the family thought I was all- Muggle
for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me
off my guard and force some magic out of me — he
pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly
drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight.
Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was
hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles
when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue
and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the
way down the garden and into the road. They were all




really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy.
And you should have seen their faces when I got in
here — they thought I might not be magic enough to
come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he
bought me my toad.”“I do hope they start right
away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly
interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning
something into something else, of course, it’s
supposed to be very difficult — “You’ll be starting
small, just matches into needles and that sort of
thing — ”“Ouch!”“What is it?”“N-nothing.”“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?”“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder
he’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He
teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyone
knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot
about the Dark Arts, Snape.”“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all
fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to
give you.

“First years should note that the forest on the
grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our
older students would do well to remember that as
well.”“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to
remind you all that no magic should be used between
classes in the corridors.

“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of
the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House
teams should contact Madam Hooch.

“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-
floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds
to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful
death.”“He’s not serious?”“Must be,”“It’s
odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’re
not allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s full of
dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he
might have told us prefects, at least.”“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school
song!”“Everyone pick their favorite tune,”“and off we go!”“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,

Teach us something please,

Whether we be old and bald
Or young with scabby knees,

Our heads could do with filling
With some interesting stuff,

For now they’re bare and full of air,

Dead flies and bits of fluff,





So teach us things worth knowing,

Bring back what we’ve forgot,

Just do your best, we’ll do the rest,

And learn until our brains all rot.”“Ah, music,”“A magic
beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you
trot!”“Peeves,”“A
poltergeist.”“Peeves — show
yourself.”“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?”“Oooooooh!”“Ickle
Firsties! What fun!”“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I
mean it!”“You want to watch out for Peeves,”“The Bloody Baron’s the only one
who can control him, he won’t even listen to us
prefects. Here we are.”“Password?”“Caput Draconis,”“Great food, isn’t it?”“Get off Scabbers! He’s chewing my
sheets.”“There, look.”“Where?”“Next to the tall kid with the red hair.”“Wearing the glasses?”“Did you see his face?”“Did you see his scar?”“GOT YOUR CONK!”“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and
dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,”“Anyone messing around in my class will leave
and not come back. You have been warned.”“What have we got today?”“Double Potions with the Slytherins,”“Snape’s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always
favors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.”“Wish McGonagall favored us,”“Ah, yes,”“Harry Potter. Our new —
celebrity.”“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art
of potion-making,”“As there is little foolish
wand- waving here, many of you will hardly believe
this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand
the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its
shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that
creep through human veins, bewitching the mind,
ensnaring the senses. ... I can teach you how to bottle
fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t
as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to
teach.”“Potter!”“What would I get if I
added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of
wormwood?”“I don’t know, sir,”“Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.”“Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told
you to find me a bezoar?”“I don’t know, sir.”“Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming,
eh, Potter?”“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood
and wolfsbane?”“I don’t know,”“I think Hermione
does, though, why don’t you try her?”“Sit down,”“For your
information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a
sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the
Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken






from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from
most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they
are the same plant, which also goes by the name of
aconite. Well? Why aren’t you all copying that down?”“And a point
will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek,
Potter.”“Idiot boy!”“I suppose you
added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron
off the fire?”“Take him up to the hospital wing,”“You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add
the quills? Thought he’d make you look good if he got
it wrong, did you? That’s another point you’ve lost for
Gryffindor.”“Don’t push it,”“I’ve heard Snape can
turn very nasty.”“Cheer up,”“Snape’s always taking points
off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid
with you?”“Back, Fang — back.”“Hang on,”“Back, Fang.”“Make yerselves at home,”“This is Ron,”“Another Weasley, eh?”“I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers
away from the forest.”“that old git.”“An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce
her to Fang sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up
ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can’t get
rid of her — Filch puts her up to it.”“But he seemed to really hate me.”“Rubbish!”“Why should he?”“How’s yer brother Charlie?”“I
liked him a lot — great with animals.”“But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep
your noses out if you know what’s good for you,”“Hagrid!”“that Gringotts break-in
happened on my birthday! It might’ve been happening
while we were there!”“Typical,”“Just what I always
wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in
front of Malfoy.”“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,”“Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always
going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet
that’s all talk.”“It’s a Remembrall!”“Gran knows I
forget things — this tells you if there’s something
you’ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this
and if it turns red — oh ...”“... you’ve
forgotten something ...”“What’s going on?”“Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.”“Just looking,”“Well, what are you all waiting for?”“Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry
up.”“Stick out your right hand over your broom,”“and say ‘Up!’ ”“UP!”“Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the
ground, hard,”“Keep your
brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight
back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle
— three — two — ”“Come back, boy!”“Broken wrist,”“Come on,
boy — it’s all right, up you get.”“None of you is to move while I take this boy to the
hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are
or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say
‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.”“Did you see his face, the great lump?”“Shut up, Malfoy,”“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?”“Never thought
you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.”“Look!”“It’s that stupid thing
Longbottom’s gran sent him.”“Give that here, Malfoy,”“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find
— how about — up a tree?”“Give it here!”“Come and get it,
Potter!”“iVo!”“Madam Hooch told
us not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.”“Give it here,”“or I’ll knock you off that
broom!”“Oh, yeah?”“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck,
Malfoy,”“Catch it if you can, then!”“HARRY POTTER!”“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ”“ — how dare
you — might have broken your neck — ”“It wasn’t his fault, Professor — ”“Be quiet, Miss Patil — ”“But Malfoy — ”“That’s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.”“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood
for a moment?”“Follow me, you two,”“In here.”“Out, Peeves!”“Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood — I’ve found you a
Seeker.”“Are you serious, Professor?”“Absolutely,”“The
boy’s a natural. I’ve never seen anything like it. Was
that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?”“He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot
dive,”“Didn’t even
scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn’t have done
it.”“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?”“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,”“He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,”“Light —
speedy — we’ll have to get him a decent broom,
Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a
Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.”“I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we
can’t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need
a better team than last year. Flattened in that last






match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in
the face for weeks. ...”“I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may
change my mind about punishing you.”“Your father would have been proud,”“He
was an excellent Quidditch player himself.”“You’re joking.”“Seeker?”“But first years never — you must
be the youngest House player in about — ”“ — a century,”“Wood told me.”“I start training next week,”“Only don’t
tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.”“Well done,”“Wood told us.
We’re on the team too — Beaters.”“I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for
sure this year,”“We haven’t won since
Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be
brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost
skipping when he told us.”“Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s
found a new secret passageway out of the school.”“Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the
Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.”“Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the
train back to the Muggles?”“You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the
ground and you’ve got your little friends with you,”“I’d take you on anytime on my own,”“Tonight, if you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only —
no contact. What’s the matter? Never heard of a
wizard’s duel before, I suppose?”“Of course he has,”“I’m
his second, who’s yours?”“Crabbe,”“Midnight all right? Well meet you
in the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.”“What is a wizard’s duel?”“And what do
you mean, you’re my second?”“Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,”“But people only die in proper duels, you know, with
real wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do
is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows
enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he
expected you to refuse, anyway.”“And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?”“Throw it away and punch him on the nose,”“Excuse me.”“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?”“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy
were saying — ”“Bet you could,”“ — and you mustn’t go wandering around the school
at night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if








you’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s really very
selfish of you.”“And it’s really none of your business,”“Good-bye,”“If he tries to
curse you, you’d better dodge it, because I can’t
remember how to block them.”“Half-past eleven,”“we’d better
go.”“I
can’t believe you’re going to do this, Harry.”“You!”“Go back to bed!”“I almost told your brother,”“Percy — he’s a prefect, he’d put a stop to this.”“Come on,”“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care
about yourselves, / don’t want Slytherin to win the
House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from
Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching
Spells.”“Go away.”“All right, but I warned you, you just remember what
I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow,
you’re so — ”“Now what am I going to do?”“That’s your problem,”“We’ve got to go,
we’re going to be late.”“I’m coming with you,”“You are not.”“D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for
Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I’ll tell
him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you
can back me up.”“You’ve got some nerve — ”“Shut up, both of you!”“I heard
something.”“Mrs. Norris?”“Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for
hours, I couldn’t remember the new password to get
in to bed.”“Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig
snout’ but it won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone
off somewhere.”“How’s your arm?”“Fine,”“Madam Pomfrey
mended it in about a minute.”“Good — well, look, Neville, we’ve got to be
somewhere, we’ll see you later — ”“Don’t leave me!”“I don’t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s
been past twice already.”“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve
learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us
about, and used it on you.”“He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,”“Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a
corner.”“They’re in here somewhere,”“probably hiding.”“This way!”“RUN!”“I think we’ve lost him,”“I — told — you,”“I — told — you.”“We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,”“quickly as possible.”“Malfoy tricked you,”“You
realize that, don’t you? He was never going to meet
you — Filch knew someone was going to be in the
trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.”“Let’s go.”“Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown
out.”“Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut,
tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.”“Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.”“Should tell Filch, I should,”“It’s for your
own good, you know.”“Get out of the way,”“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!”“STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS
CORRIDOR!”“This is it!”“We’re done for! This is the end!”“Oh, move over,”“Alohomora”“Which way did they go, Peeves?”“Quick, tell me.”“Say ‘please.’ ”“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?”“Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,”“All right — please.”“NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing
if you didn’t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!”“He thinks this door is locked,”“I
think well be okay — get off Neville!”“What?”“Where on earth have you all been?”“Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,”“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?”“If
any dog needs exercise, that one does.”“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?”“Didn’t you see what it was standing on?”“The floor?”“I wasn’t looking at its
feet, I was too busy with its heads.”“No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s
obviously guarding something.”“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all
have been killed — or worse, expelled. Now, if you
don’t mind, I’m going to bed.”“No, we don’t mind,”“You’d think we dragged
her along, wouldn’t you?”“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,”“Or both,”“A Nimbus Two Thousand!”“I’ve never even touched one.”“That’s a broomstick,”“You’ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren’t
allowed them.”“It’s not any old broomstick,”“it’s a Nimbus
Two Thousand. What did you say you’ve got at home,
Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?”“Comets look flashy, but they’re not in the same
league as the Nimbus.”“What would you know about it, Weasley, you
couldn’t afford half the handle,”“I suppose you and your brothers have to save up
twig by twig.”“Not arguing, I hope, boys?”“Potters been sent a broomstick, Professor,”“Yes, yes, that’s right,”“Professor McGonagall told me all
about the special circumstances, Potter. And what
model is it?”“A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,”“And it’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I’ve got it,”“Well, it’s true,”“If he hadn’t stolen
Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team. ...”“So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking
rules?”“I thought you weren’t speaking to us?”“Yes, don’t stop now,”“it’s doing us so
much good.”“Wow,”“Hey, Potter, come down!”“Very nice,”“I see what
McGonagall meant ... you really are a natural. I’m
just going to teach you the rules this evening, then
you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.”“Right,”“Now, Quidditch is easy enough to
understand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are
seven players on each side. Three of them are called
Chasers.”“Three Chasers,”“This ball’s called the Quaffle,”“The
Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and
get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten
points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the
hoops. Follow me?”“The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through
the hoops to score,”“So — that’s sort of
like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t
it?”“What’s basketball?”“Never mind,”“Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called
the Keeper — I’m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly
around our hoops and stop the other team from
scoring.”“Three Chasers, one Keeper,”“And they play with
the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?”“I’ll show you now,”“Take this.”“I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,”“These two are the Bludgers.”“Stand back,”“See?”“The
Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off
their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on
each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s their
job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and
knock them toward the other team. So — think you’ve
got all that?”“Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the
Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the
Bludgers away from their team,”“Very good,”“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?”“Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken
jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last
member of the team is the Seeker. That’s you. And
you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the
Bludgers — ”“ — unless they crack my head open.”“Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for
the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of human
Bludgers themselves.”“This,”“is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the
most important ball of the lot. It’s very hard to catch
because it’s so fast and difficult to see. It’s the
Seeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave in and out
of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get
it before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever
Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra
hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win.
That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of
Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it
can go on for ages — I think the record is three
months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so
the players could get some sleep.

“Well, that’s it — any questions?”“We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,”“it’s too
dark, we might lose it. Let’s try you out with a few of
these.”“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,”“I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better
than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for
England if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.”“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve
been practicing!”“Swish
and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the
magic words properly is very important, too — never





forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s’ instead of ‘f and
found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his
chest.”“Wingardium Leviosal”“You’re saying it wrong,”“It’s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and
long.”“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,”“Wingardium LeviosaV’

Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four
feet above their heads.

“Oh, well done!”“Everyone see here, Miss Granger’s done it!”“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,”“she’s a nightmare, honestly.”“I think she heard you.”“So?”“She must’ve noticed she’s got no friends.”“Troll — in
the dungeons — thought you ought to know.”“Prefects,”“lead your Houses back to the
dormitories immediately!”“Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear
the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind
me, now. Make way, first years coming through!
Excuse me, I’m a prefect!”“How could a troll get in?”“Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,”“Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween
joke.”“I’ve just thought — Hermione.”“What about her?”“She doesn’t know about the troll.”“Oh, all right,”“But Percy’d better not
see us.”“Percy!”“What’s he doing?”“Why isn’t he
down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?”“Search me.”“He’s heading for the third floor,”“Can you smell something?”“The key’s in the lock,”“We could
lock it in.”“Good idea,”“Yes!”“Oh, no,”“It’s the girls’ bathroom!”“ Hermionel”“Confuse it!”“Oy, pea-brain!”“Come on, run, run”“Wingardium Leviosal”“Is it — dead?”“I don’t think so,”“I think it’s just been
knocked out.”“Urgh — troll boogers.”“What on earth were you thinking of?”“You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you
in your dormitory?”“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for
me.”“Miss Granger!”“I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I
could deal with it on my own — you know, because
I’ve read all about them.”“If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry
stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out
with its own club. They didn’t have time to come and
fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they
arrived.”“Well — in that case ...”“Miss Granger, you
foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a
mountain troll on your own?”“Miss Granger, five points will be taken from
Gryffindor for this,”“I’m
very disappointed in you. If you’re not hurt at all,
you’d better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are
finishing the feast in their Houses.”“Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first
years could have taken on a full-grown mountain
troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor
Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.”“We should have gotten more than ten points,”“Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione ’s.”“Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,”“Mind you, we did save her.”“She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t
locked the thing in with her,”“Pig snout,”“Thanks,”“What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?”“Library books are not to be taken outside the
school,”“Give it to me. Five points from
Gryffindor.”“He’s just made that rule up,”“Wonder what’s wrong with
his leg?”“Dunno, but I hope it’s really hurting him,”“How will you learn?”“Better you than me,”“Blasted thing,”“How are you
supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at
once?”“POTTER!”“I just wondered if I could have my book back.”“GET OUT! OUT!”“Did you get it?”“What’s the matter?”“You know what this means?”“He tried to get past that three-headed
dog at Halloween! That’s where he was going when we
saw him — he’s after whatever it’s guarding! And I’d
bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a
diversion!”“No — he wouldn’t,”“I know he’s not very
nice, but he wouldn’t try and steal something
Dumbledore was keeping safe.”“Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints
or something,”“I’m with Harry. I








wouldn’t put anything past Snape. But what’s he
after? What’s that dog guarding?”“You’ve got to eat some breakfast.”“I don’t want anything.”“Just a bit of toast,”“I’m not hungry.”“Harry, you need your strength,”“Seekers are always the ones who get
clobbered by the other team.”“Thanks, Seamus,”“Okay, men,”“And women,”“And women,”“This is it.”“The big one,”“The one we’ve all been waiting for,”“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,”“we were on the team last year.”“Shut up, you two,”“This is the best team
Gryffindor’s had in years. We’re going to win. I know
it.”“Or else.”“Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.”“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,”“Mount your brooms, please.”“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina
Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser
that girl is, and rather attractive, too — ”“JORDAN!”“Sorry, Professor.”“And she’s really belting along up there, a neat pass
to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last
year only a reserve — back to Johnson and — no, the
Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain
Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes — Flint





flying like an eagle up there — he’s going to sc- no,
stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper
Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s
Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive
around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that
must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a
Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s
Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but
he’s blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by
Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play
by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back
in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and
off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding
Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now,
Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses —
GRYFFINDORS SCORE!”“Budge up there, move along.”“Hagrid!”“Bin watchin’ from me hut,”“But it isn’t
the same as bein’ in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch
yet, eh?”“Nope,”“Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.”“Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,”“Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the
Snitch,”“We don’t want you attacked
before you have to be.”“All right there, Harry?”“Slytherin in possession,”“Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys,
and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the — wait a
moment — was that the Snitch?”“Foul!”“Send
him off, ref! Red card!”“What are you talking about, Dean?”“Red card!”“In soccer you get
shown the red card and you’re out of the game!”“But this isn’t soccer, Dean,”“They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked
Harry outta the air.”“So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of
cheating — ”“Jordan!”“I mean, after that open and revolting foul — ”“Jordan, I’m warning you — ”“All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor
Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a
penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it
away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor
still in possession.”“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle —
passes Spinnet — passes Bell — hit hard in the face
by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking,
Professor — Slytherins score — oh no ...”“Dunno what Harry thinks he’s doing,”“If I
didn’ know better, I’d say he’d lost control of his
broom ... but he can’t have. ...”“Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?”“Can’t have,”“Can’t
nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful
Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two
Thousand.”“What are you doing?”“I knew it,”“Snape — look.”“He’s doing something — jinxing the broom,”“What should we do?”“Leave it to me.”“Come on, Hermione,”“Neville, you can look!”“I’ve got the Snitch!”“He didn’t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,”“It was Snape,”“Hermione and I
saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering,
he wouldn’t take his eyes off you.”“Rubbish,”“Why
would Snape do somethin’ like that?”“I found out something about him,”“He tried to get past that three-headed dog on
Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal
whatever it’s guarding.”“How do you know about Fluffy?”“ Fluffy ?”“Yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie
I met in the pub las’ year — I lent him to Dumbledore
to guard the — ”“Yes?”“Now, don’t ask me anymore,”“That’s top secret, that is.”“But Snape’s trying to steal it.”“Rubbish,”“Snape’s a Hogwarts
teacher, he’d do nothin’ of the sort.”“So why did he just try and kill Harry?”“I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all
about them! You’ve got to keep eye contact, and
Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw him!”“I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!”“I don’
know why Harry’s broom acted like that, but Snape
wouldn’ try an’ kill a student! Now, listen to me, all
three of yeh — yer meddlin’ in things that don’
concern yeh. It’s dangerous. You forget that dog, an’
you forget what it’s guardin’, that’s between Professor
Dumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel — ■”“Aha!”“so there’s someone called Nicolas
Flamel involved, is there?”“I do feel so sorry,”“for all those people who have to stay at







Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted
at home.”“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?”“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.”“Would you mind moving out of the way?”“Are you trying
to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be
gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I
suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a
palace compared to what your family’s used to.”“WEASLEY!”“He was provoked, Professor Snape,”“Malfoy was insultin’ his family.”“Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules,
Hagrid,”“Five points from
Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn’t more.
Move along, all of you.”“I’ll get him,”“one of these days, I’ll get him — ”“I hate them both,”“Malfoy and Snape.”“Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,”“Tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the
Great Hall, looks a treat.”“Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner,
would you?”“How many days you got left until yer holidays?”“Just one,”“And that reminds me —
Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we
should be in the library.”“Oh yeah, you’re right,”“The library?”“Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?”“Oh, we’re not working,”“Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been
trying to find out who he is.”“You what?”“Listen here —
I’ve told yeh — drop it. It’s nothin’ to you what that
dog’s guardin’.”“We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s
all,”“Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?”“We must’ve been through hundreds of
books already and we can’t find him anywhere — just








give us a hint — I know I’ve read his name
somewhere.”“I’m sayin’ nothin’,”“Just have to find out for ourselves, then,”“What are you looking for, boy?”“Nothing,”“You’d better get out, then. Go on — out!”“You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?”“And send me an owl if you find
anything.”“And you could ask your parents if they know who
Flamel is,”“It’d be safe to ask them.”“Very safe, as they’re both dentists,”“Don’t
send me there, can’t you see his knight? Send him, we
can afford to lose him.”“Merry Christmas,”“You, too,”“Will you look at this? I’ve got
some presents!”“What did you expect, turnips?”“That’s friendly,”“ Weird ”“What a shape! This is money?”“You can keep it,”“Hagrid and my aunt and uncle —
so who sent these?”“I think I know who that one’s from,”“My mom. I told her you didn’t expect any
presents and — oh, no,”“she’s made you
a Weasley sweater.”“Every year she makes us a sweater,”“and mine’s always maroon.”“That’s really nice of her,”“I’ve heard of those,”“If that’s what I think it is — they’re
really rare, and really valuable.”“What is it?”“It’s an Invisibility Cloak,”“I’m sure it is — try it on.”“It is! Look down!”“There’s a note!”“A note fell out of
it!”“I’d give anuthinq for one of these,”“Anuthinq.
What’s the matter?”“Nothing,”“Merry Christmas!”“Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!”“Harry’s is better than ours, though,”“She obviously makes
more of an effort if you’re not family.”“Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?”“Come on, get it on, they’re lovely and
warm.”“I hate maroon,”“You haven’t got a letter on yours,”“I suppose she thinks you don’t forget your name. But
we’re not stupid — we know we’re called Gred and
Forge.”“What’s all this noise?”“P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we’re all
wearing ours, even Harry got one.”“I — don’t — want — ”“And you’re not sitting with the prefects today,
either,”“Christmas is a time for family.”“Who’s there?”“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if
anyone was wandering around at night, and
somebody’s been in the library — Restricted Section.”“The Restricted Section? Well,
they can’t be far, we’ll catch them.”“Mom?”“Dad?”“I’ll come back,”“You could have woken me up,”“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show
you the mirror.”“I’d like to see your mom and dad,”“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys,
you’ll be able to show me your other brothers and
everyone.”“You can see them any old time,”“Just
come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe
it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding
Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why
aren’t you eating anything?”“Are you all right?”“You look odd.”“I’m freezing,”“Let’s forget it and go back.”“IVo!”“I know it’s here somewhere.”“It’s here — just here — yes!”“See?”“I can’t see anything.”“Look! Look at them all ... there are loads of them. ...”“I can only see you.”“Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.”“Look at me!”“Can you see all your family standing around you?”“No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older —
and I’m Head Boy!”“What?”“I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and
I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup —
I’m Quidditch captain, too!”“Do you think this mirror shows the future?”“How can it? All my family are dead — let me have
another look — ”“You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit
more time.”“You’re only holding the Quidditch Cup, what’s
interesting about that? I want to see my parents.”“Don’t push me — ”“Quick!”“This isn’t safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet
she heard us. Come on.”“Want to play chess, Harry?”“No.”“Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid?”“No ... you go ...”“I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that
mirror. Don’t go back tonight.”“Why not?”“I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and
anyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already.
Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around.
So what if they can’t see you? What if they walk into
you? What if you knock something over?”“You sound like Hermione.”“I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.”“So — back again, Harry?”“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make
you,”“So,”“you, like hundreds before you,
have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.”“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.”“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”“It — well — it shows me my family — ”“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”“How did you know — ?”“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,”“Now, can you think what the
Mirror of Erised shows us all?”“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be
able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror,
that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly
as he is. Does that help?”“It shows us
what we want ... whatever we want ...”“Yes and no,”“It shows us
nothing more or less than the deepest, most
desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never
known your family, see them standing around you.
Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed
by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best
of all of them. However, this mirror will give us
neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away
before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been
driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or
even possible.

“The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow,
Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If
you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It
does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live,
remember that. Now, why don’t you put that
admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?”“Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you
something?”“Obviously, you’ve just done so,”“You may ask me one more thing, however.”“What do you see when you look in the mirror?”“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.”“One can never have enough socks,”“Another Christmas has come and gone








and I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist on
giving me books.”“You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could
drive you mad,”“If Filch had
caught you!”“Will you stop messing around!”“That’s
exactly the sort of thing that’ll lose us the match!
Snape’s refereeing this time, and he’ll be looking for
any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!”“ Snape’s refereeing?”“When’s he ever refereed a
Quidditch match? He’s not going to be fair if we might
overtake Slytherin.”“It’s not my fault,”“We’ve just got to make
sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an
excuse to pick on us.”“Don’t talk to me for a moment,”“I need to concern”“What’s the matter with you?

You look terrible.”“Don’t play,”“Say you’re ill,”“Pretend to break your leg,”“ Really break your leg,”“I can’t,”“There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I
back out, Gryffindor can’t play at all.”“What happened?”“Malfoy,”“I met him outside the
library. He said he’d been looking for someone to
practice that on.”“Go to Professor McGonagall!”“Report him!”“I don’t want more trouble,”“You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville!”“He’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no
reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.”“There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be
in Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that,”“You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,”“The
Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And
where’s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.”“Thanks, Harry ... I think I’ll go to bed. ... D’you want
the card, you collect them, don’t you?”“Dumbledore again,”“He was the first one I
ever — ”“I’ve found him”“I’ve found Flamel! I
told you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read it
on the train coming here — listen to this:

‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of
the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the
discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his
work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel’V’

Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn’t looked so
excited since they’d gotten back the marks for their
very first piece of homework.

“Stay there!”“I never thought to look in here!”“I got this out of the library weeks ago for a
bit of light reading.”“Light?”“I knew it! I knew it!”“Are we allowed to speak yet?”“Nicolas Flamel,”“is the
only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone”“The what?”“Oh, honestly , don’t you two read? Look — read that,
there.”“See?”“The dog must be guarding Flamel’s
Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep
it safe for him, because they’re friends and he knew
someone was after it, that’s why he wanted the Stone
moved out of Gringotts!”“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever
dying!”“No wonder Snape’s after it!

Anyone would want it.”“And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study
of Recent Developments in Wizardry,”“He’s
not exactly recent if he’s six hundred and sixty-five, is
he?”“I’m going to play,”“If I
don’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared
to face Snape. I’ll show them ... it’ll really wipe the
smiles off their faces if we win.”“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,”“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,”“I know,”“Don’t nag.”“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever
need an early capture of the Snitch it’s now. Finish






the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too
much.”“The whole school’s out there!”“Even — blimey —
Dumbledore’s come to watch!”“Dumbledore?”“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,”“Look — they’re off. Ouch!”“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.”“Wonder how long Potter’s going to stay on his broom
this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you,
Weasley?”“You know how I think they choose people for the
Gryffindor team?”“It’s people they feel sorry for.

See, there’s Potter, who’s got no parents, then there’s
the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be
on the team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.”“I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,”“You tell him, Neville.”“Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than
Weasley, and that’s saying something.”“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word — ”“Ron!”“Harry — !”“What? Where?”“You’re in luck, Weasley, Potter’s obviously spotted
some money on the ground!”“Come on, Harry!”“Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game’s over! Harry’s
won! We’ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!”“Well done,”“Nice to see you haven’t been
brooding about that mirror . . . been keeping busy . . .
excellent ...”“... d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of
all p-places, Severus ...”“Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,”“Students aren’t supposed to know about
the Sorcerer’s Stone, after all.”“Have you found out how to get past that beast of
Hagrid’s yet?”“B-b-but Severus, I — ”“You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,”“I-I don’t know what you — ”“You know perfectly well what I mean.”“ — your little bit of hocus-pocus. I’m waiting.”“B-but I d-d-don’t — ”“Very well,”“Well have another little
chat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over
and decided where your loyalties lie.”“Harry, where have you been?”“We won! You won! We won!”“And I gave Malfoy a black eye,
and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-
handed! He’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says
he’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin!
Everyone’s waiting for you in the common room, we’re
having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and
stuff from the kitchens.”“Never mind that now,”“Let’s
find an empty room, you wait ’til you hear this. ...”“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and
Snape’s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He
asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy — and he said
something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon
there are other things guarding the stone apart from
Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell








would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that
Snape needs to break through — ”“So you mean the Stone’s only safe as long as Quirrell
stands up to Snape?”“It’ll be gone by next Tuesday,”“Hermione, the exams are ages away.”“Ten weeks,”“That’s not ages,
that’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.”“But we’re not six hundred years old,”“Anyway, what are you studying for, you already
know it all.”“What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize
we need to pass these exams to get into the second
year? They’re very important, I should have started
studying a month ago, I don’t know what’s gotten into
me.”“I’ll never remember this,”“Dittany”“Hagrid! What are you doing in the
library?”“Jus’ lookin’,”“An’ what’re you lot up ter?”“Yer not still lookin’ fer
Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?”“Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,”“And we know what that dog’s guarding,
it’s a Sorcerer’s St — ”“Shhhh”“Don’ go shoutin’ about it,
what’s the matter with yeh?”“There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a
matter of fact,”“about what’s guarding
the Stone apart from Fluffy — ”“SHHHH!”“Listen — come an’ see
me later, I’m not promisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind,
but don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here, students aren’
s’pposed ter know. They’ll think I’ve told yeh — ”“See you later, then,”“What was he hiding behind his back?”“Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?”“I’m going to see what section he was in,”“Dragons'.”“Hagrid was looking up stuff
about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great
Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon
Keeper’s Guide.”“Hagrid ’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the
first time I ever met him,”“But it’s against our laws,”“Dragon
breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks’ Convention
of 1709, everyone knows that. It’s hard to stop
Muggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons in
the back garden — anyway, you can’t tame dragons,
it’s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie’s got
off wild ones in Romania.”“But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain?”“Of course there are,”“Common Welsh
Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic
has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind
have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted
them, to make them forget.”“So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?”“Who is it?”“So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?”“Yes,”“We were wondering if you could tell us
what’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from
Fluffy.”“O’ course I can’t,”“Number one, I don’ know
meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I
wouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone’s here fer a good
reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I
s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all? Beats me how
yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.”“Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us,
but you do know, you know everything that goes on
round here,”“We only wondered who had done the
guarding, really.”`
let text3 = `“We wondered
who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him,
apart from you.”“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that ...
let’s see ... he borrowed Fluffy from me ... then some
o’ the teachers did enchantments ... Professor Sprout
— Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ”“Professor Quirrell —
an’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course.

Hang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor
Snape.”“Snape?”“Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look,
Snape helped protect the Stone, he’s not about ter
steal it.”“You’re the only one who knows how to get past
Fluffy, aren’t you, Hagrid?”“And you wouldn’t tell anyone, would you? Not even
one of the teachers?”“Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,”“Well, that’s something,”“Hagrid, can we have a window open? I’m
boiling.”“Can’t, Harry, sorry,”“Hagrid — what’s that?”“Ah,”“That’s — er ...”“Where did you get it, Hagrid?”“It must’ve
cost you a fortune.”“Won it,”“Las’ night. I was down in the
village havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards
with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of
it, ter be honest.”“But what are you going to do with it when it’s
hatched?”“Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,”“Got this outta the
library — Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit —
it’s a bit outta date, o’ course, but it’s all in here. Keep
the egg in the fire, ’cause their mothers breathe on
’em, see, an’ when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o’
brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An’
see here — how ter recognize diff’rent eggs — what I
got there’s a Norwegian Ridge-back. They’re rare,
them.”“Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,”“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,”“Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going
to see a dragon hatching?”“We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s
nothing to what Hagrid ’s going to be in when someone
finds out what he’s doing — ”“Shut up!”“It’s nearly out.”“Isn’t he beautiful?”“Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!”“Hagrid,”“how fast do Norwegian
Ridgebacks grow, exactly?”“What’s the matter?”“Someone was lookin’ through the gap in the curtains
— it’s a kid — he’s runnin’ back up ter the school.”“Just let him go,”“Set him free.”“I can’t,”“He’s too little. He’d die.”“I’ve decided to call him Norbert,”“He really knows me
now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where’s Mommy?”“He’s lost his marbles,”“Hagrid,”“give it two weeks and
Norbert’s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy
could go to Dumbledore at any moment.”“I — I know I can’t keep him forever, but I can’t jus’
dump him, can’t.”“Charlie,”“You’re losing it, too,”“I’m Ron, remember?”“No — Charlie — your brother, Charlie. In Romania.
Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him.
Charlie can take care of him and then put him back
in the wild!”“Brilliant!”“How about it, Hagrid?”“It bit me!”“I’m not going
to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that
dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but
the way Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a
fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off
for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a
lullaby.”“It’s Hedwig!”“She’ll
have Charlie’s answer!”“We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak,”“It
shouldn’t be too difficult — I think the cloak’s big
enough to cover two of us and Norbert.”“It’s not just my hand,”“although that
feels like it’s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam
Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he
could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept
threatening to tell her what really bit me — I’ve told
her it was a dog, but I don’t think she believes me — I
shouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that’s
why he’s doing this.”“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,”“Midnight on Saturday!”“Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s
letter was in that book Malfoy took, he’s going to
know we’re getting rid of Norbert.”“It’s too late to change the plan now,”“We haven’t got time to send Charlie
another owl, and this could be our only chance to get
rid of Norbert. We’ll have to risk it. And we have got
the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about
that.”“I won’t let you in,”“Norbert’s at a tricky
stage — nothin’ I can’t handle.”“Aargh! It’s all right, he only got my boot — jus’
playin’ — he’s only a baby, after all.”“He’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,”“An’ I’ve packed his
teddy bear in case he gets lonely.”“Bye-bye, Norbert!”“Mommy will
never forget you!”“Nearly there!”“Detention!”“And twenty points from
Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the
night, how dare you — ”“You don’t understand, Professor. Harry Potter’s
coming — he’s got a dragon!”“What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies!
Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you,
Malfoy!”“Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!”“Don’t,”“Well, well, well,”“we are in trouble.”“Harry!”“I was trying to find you to warn you, I
heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he
said you had a drag — ”“I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch
says you were up in the Astronomy Tower. It’s one
o’clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.”“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,”“It doesn’t take a genius
to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-
bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed
and into trouble. I’ve already caught him. I suppose
you think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the
story and believed it, too?”“I’m disgusted,”“Four
students out of bed in one night! I’ve never heard of
such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you
had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought
Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of
you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr.
Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk





around school at night, especially these days, it’s very
dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from
Gryffindor.”“Fifty?”“Fifty points each,”“Professor — please — ”“You can’t—”“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Potter. Now get
back to bed, all of you. I’ve never been more ashamed
of Gryffindor students.”“Thanks Potter, we owe you one!”“They’ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George
have lost loads of points in all the time they’ve been
here, and people still like them.”“They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one
go, though, have they?”“Well — no,”“Resign?”“What good’ll that do?

How are we going to get any points back if we can’t
win at Quidditch?”“the
Seeker.”“No — no — not again, please — ”“All right — all right — ”“Snape’s done it, then!”“If Quirrell’s told
him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell — ”“There’s still Fluffy, though,”“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him
without asking Hagrid,”“I bet there’s a
book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a
giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?”“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done
ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown
out for sure.”“But we’ve got no proof.”“Quirrell’s too
scared to back us up. Snape’s only got to say he
doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and
that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do
you think they’ll believe, him or us? It’s not exactly a
secret we hate him, Dumbledore ’ll think we made it
up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life
depended on it, he’s too friendly with Snape, and the
more students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think.
And don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about
the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of explaining.”“If we just do a bit of poking around — ”“No,”“we’ve done enough poking
around.”“Follow me,”“I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule
again, won’t you, eh?”“Oh
yes . . . hard work and pain are the best teachers if you
ask me. ... It’s just a pity they let the old
punishments die out . . . hang you by your wrists from





the ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the chains still in
my office, keep ’em well oiled in case they’re ever
needed. ... Right, off we go, and don’t think of running
off, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.”“Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.”“I
suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with
that oaf? Well, think again, boy — it’s into the forest
you’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come
out in one piece.”“The forest?”“We can’t go in there at night —
there’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I
heard.”“That’s your problem, isn’t it?”“Should’ve thought of them
werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn’t you?”“Abou’ time,”“I bin waitin’ fer half an hour
already. All right, Harry, Hermione?”“I shouldn’t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,”“they’re here to be punished, after all.”“That’s why yer late, is it?”“Bin lecturin’ them, eh? ’Snot your place ter do
that. Yeh’ve done yer bit, I’ll take over from here.”“I’ll be back at dawn,”“for what’s left of
them,”“I’m not going in that forest,”“Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,”“Yeh’ve done wrong an’ now yeh’ve got
ter pay fer it.”“But this is servant stuff, it’s not for students to do. I
thought we’d be copying lines or something, if my
father knew I was doing this, he’d — ”“ — tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts,”“Copyin’ lines! What good’s that ter anyone?
Yeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get out. If yeh think
yer father’d rather you were expelled, then get back
off ter the castle an’ pack. Go on!”“Right then,”“now, listen carefully,

’cause it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’
I don’ want no one takin’ risks. Follow me over here a
moment.”“Look there,”“see that stuff shinin’ on
the ground? Silvery stuff? That’s unicorn blood.
There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat.
This is the second time in a week. I found one dead
last Wednesday. We’re gonna try an’ find the poor
thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.”“And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us
first?”“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh
if yer with me or Fang,”“An’ keep ter the
path. Right, now, we’re gonna split inter two parties
an’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions. There’s blood
all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around
since last night at least.”“I want Fang,”“All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,”“So me, Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco,
Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the other. Now, if any of us
finds the unicorn, we’ll send up green sparks, right?






Get yer wands out an’ practice now — that’s it — an’
if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an’ we’ll
all come an’ find yeh — so, be careful — let’s go.”“ Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?”“Not fast enough,”“It’s not easy ter catch
a unicorn, they’re powerful magic creatures. I never
knew one ter be hurt before.”“You all right, Hermione?”“Don’
worry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’
then well be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE!”“I knew it,”“There’s summat in here
that shouldn’ be.”“A werewolf?”“That wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn,
neither,”“Right, follow me, but
careful, now.”“Who’s there?”“Show yerself — I’m
armed!”“Oh, it’s you, Ronan,”“How are
yeh?”“Good evening to you, Hagrid,”“Were you going to shoot me?”“Can’t be too careful, Ronan,”“There’s summat bad loose in this forest.
This is Harry Potter an’ Hermione Granger, by the
way. Students up at the school. An’ this is Ronan,
you two. He’s a centaur.”“We’d noticed,”“Good evening,”“Students, are you? And
do you learn much, up at the school?”“Erm — ”“A bit,”“A bit. Well, that’s something.”“Mars is
bright tonight.”“Yeah,”“Listen, I’m glad
we’ve run inter yeh, Ronan, ’cause there’s a unicorn
bin hurt — you seen anythin’?”“Always the innocent are the first victims,”“So it has been for ages past, so it is now.”“Yeah,”“but have yeh seen anythin’,
Ronan? Anythin’ unusual?”“Mars is bright tonight,”“Unusually bright.”“Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit
nearer home,”“So yeh haven’t noticed
anythin’ strange?”“The forest hides many secrets.”“Hullo, Bane,”“All right?”“Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?”“Well enough. Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ronan, you
seen anythin’ odd in here lately? There’s a unicorn
bin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it?”“Mars is bright tonight,”“We’ve heard,”“Well, if either of
you do see anythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? We’ll be
off, then.”“Never,”“try an’ get a straight
answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not
interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.”“Are there many of them in here?”“Oh, a fair few. . . . Keep themselves to themselves
mostly, but they’re good enough about turnin’ up if
ever I want a word. They’re deep, mind, centaurs ...
they know things ... jus’ don’ let on much.”“D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?”“Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask
me, that was what’s bin killin’ the unicorns — never
heard anythin’ like it before.”“Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!”“You two wait here!”“Stay on the
path, I’ll come back for yeh!”“You don’t think they’ve been hurt, do you?”“I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got
Neville ... it’s our fault he’s here in the first place.”“Well be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with the racket
you two were makin’. Right, we’re changin’ groups —
Neville, you stay with me an’ Hermione, Harry, you go
with Fang an’ this idiot. I’m sorry,”“but he’ll have a harder time
frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done.”“Look — ”“AAAAAAAAAAARGH ! ”“Are you all right?”“Yes — thank you — what was that?”“You are the Potter boy,”“You had better get
back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time —
especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker
this way.

“My name is Firenze,”“Firenze!”“What are you doing? You
have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are
you a common mule?”“Do you realize who this is?”“This is the
Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the
better.”“What have you been telling him?”“Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set
ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what
is to come in the movements of the planets?”“I’m sure Firenze
thought he was acting for the best,”“For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs
are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not
our business to run around like donkeys after stray
humans in our forest!”“Do you not see that unicorn?”“Do you not understand why it was killed? Or
have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set
myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane,
yes, with humans alongside me if I must.”“Why’s Bane so angry?”“What was that
thing you saved me from, anyway?”“Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is
used for?”“No,”“We’ve
only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.”“That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a
unicorn,”“Only one who has nothing to
lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a
crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even
if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price.
You have slain something pure and defenseless to
save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a
cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your
lips.”“But who’d be that desperate?”“If
you’re going to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t
it?”“It is,”“unless all you need is to stay
alive long enough to drink something else —
something that will bring you back to full strength
and power — something that will mean you can never
die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the
school at this very moment?”“The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life!
But I don’t understand who — ”“Can you think of nobody who has waited many years
to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting
their chance?”“Some say he died.
Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough
human left in him to die.”“Do you mean,”“that was VoZ — ”“Harry! Harry, are you all right?”“I’m fine,”“The unicorn’s dead, Hagrid, it’s in that
clearing back there.”“This is where I leave you,”“You are
safe now.”“Good luck, Harry Potter,”“The planets
have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs.
I hope this is one of those times.”“Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort ... and
Voldemort’s waiting in the forest ... and all this time
we thought Snape just wanted to get rich. ...”“Stop saying the name!”“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so. ...
Bane was furious ... he was talking about interfering
with what the planets say is going to happen. ... They
must show that Voldemort’s coming back. ... Bane
thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me. ... I
suppose that’s written in the stars as well.”“Will you stop saying the name”“So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the
Stone,”“then Voldemort will
be able to come and finish me off. ... Well, I suppose
Bane 11 be happy.”“Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one
You-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore
around, You-Know-Who won’t touch you. Anyway,
who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like
fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says
that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.”“That was far easier than I thought it would be,”“I needn’t have learned about the
1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of
Elfric the Eager.”“No more studying,”“You could look more cheerful,

Harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly
we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.”“I wish I knew what this means”“My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but
never as often as this.”“Go to Madam Pomfrey,”“I’m not ill,”“I think it’s a warning ... it
means danger’s coming. ...”“Harry, relax, Hermione ’s right, the Stone’s safe as
long as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never
had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy.
He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to
try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch
for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.”“That’s just the exams. I woke up last
night and was halfway through my Transfiguration
notes before I remembered we’d done that one.”“Where ’re you going?”“I’ve just thought of something,”“We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.”“Why?”“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,”“that what Hagrid
wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a
stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in
his pocket? How many people wander around with
dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky they
found Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it
before?”“What are you talking about?”“Hullo,”“Finished yer exams? Got
time fer a drink?”“Yes, please,”“No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you
something. You know that night you won Norbert?
What did the stranger you were playing cards with
look like?”“Dunno said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his
cloak off.”“It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in
the Hog’s Head — that’s one o’ the pubs down in the
village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he? I
never saw his face, he kept his hood up.”“What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you
mention Hogwarts at all?”“Mighta come up,”“Yeah ... he asked what I did, an’ I told
him I was gamekeeper here. ... He asked a bit about
the sorta creatures I look after ... so I told him ... an’ I
said what I’d always really wanted was a dragon ...
an’ then ... I can’ remember too well, ’cause he kept
buyin’ me drinks. ... Let’s see ... yeah, then he said he
had the dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I
wanted . . . but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he
didn’ want it ter go ter any old home. ... So I told him,
after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy. ...”“And did he — did he seem interested in Fluffy?”“Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh
meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a
piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’
play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter
sleep — ”“I shouldn’ta told yeh that!”“Forget I
said it! Hey — where’re yeh goin’?”“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,”“Hagrid
told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was
either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it
must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just
hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us
up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s Dumbledore’s
office?”“Well just have to — ”“What are you three doing inside?”“We want to see Professor Dumbledore,”“See Professor Dumbledore?”“Why?”“It’s sort of secret,”“Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,”“He received an urgent owl from the Ministry
of Magic and flew off for London at once.”“He’s gone?”“Now?”“Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter,
he has many demands on his time — ”“But this is important.”“Something you have to say is more important than
the Ministry of Magic, Potter?”“Look,”“Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ”“How do you know — ?”“Professor, I think — I know — that Sn — that
someone’s going to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to
talk to Professor Dumbledore.”“Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,”“I don’t know how you found out about
the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal
it, it’s too well protected.”“But Professor — ”“Potter, I know what I’m talking about,”“I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy
the sunshine.”“It’s tonight,”“Snape’s going
through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out
everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore
out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of
Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns
up.”“But what can we — ”“Good afternoon,”“You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,”“We were — ”“You want to be more careful,”“Hanging
around like this, people will think you’re up to
something. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose
any more points, can it?”“Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings
and I will personally make sure you are expelled.

Good day to you.”“Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,”“One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape
— wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he
leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.”“Why me?”“It’s obvious,”“You can pretend to be
waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.”“ ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I
think I got question fourteen b wrong. . . . ’ ”“Oh, shut up,”“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,”“Come on.”“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a
pack of enchantments!”“Enough of this
nonsense! If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here
again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor!

Yes, Weasley, from my own House!”“At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,”“I’m sorry, Harry!”“Snape came out and
asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for
Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I’ve only
just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.”“Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?”“I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and
get to the Stone first.”“You’re mad!”“You can’t!”“After what McGonagall
and Snape have said? You’ll be expelled!”“SO WHAT?”“Don’t you understand?
If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming
back! Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was
trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to
get expelled from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a
school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter
anymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you
and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House
Cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well,
I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for
Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later
than I would have, because I’m never going over to
the Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor
tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me!
Voldemort killed my parents, remember?”“You’re right, Harry,”“I’ll use the Invisibility Cloak,”“It’s just
lucky I got it back.”“But will it cover all three of us?”“All — all three of us?”“Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go
alone?”“Of course not,”“How do you
think you’d get to the Stone without us? I’d better go
and look through my books, there might be
something useful. ...”“But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.”“Not if I can help it,”“Flitwick
told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve
percent on his exam. They’re not throwing me out
after that.”“Better get the cloak,”“We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it
covers all three of us — if Filch spots one of our feet
wandering along on its own — ”“What are you doing?”“Nothing, Neville, nothing,”“You’re going out again,”“No, no, no,”“No, we’re not. Why don’t
you go to bed, Neville?”“You can’t go out,”“you’ll be caught
again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.”“You don’t understand,”“this is
important.”“I won’t let you do it,”“I’ll — I’ll fight you!”“Neville,”“get away from that hole and
don’t be an idiot — ”“Don’t you call me an idiot!”“I don’t
think you should be breaking any more rules! And
you were the one who told me to stand up to people!”“Yes, but not to us,”“Neville, you don’t know what you’re doing.”“Go on then, try and hit me!”“I’m ready!”“Do something,”“Neville,”“I’m really, really sorry about this.”“Petrificus Totalusl”“What’ve you done to him?”“It’s the full Body-Bind,”“Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.”“We had to, Neville, no time to explain,”“You’ll understand later, Neville,”“Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,”“Who’s there?”“Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you. Are you
ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?”“Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping
around unseen.”“Peeves,”“the Bloody
Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.”“So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,”“My mistake, my mistake — I didn’t see you
— of course I didn’t, you’re invisible — forgive old
Peevsie his little joke, sir.”“I have business here, Peeves,”“Stay
away from this place tonight.”“I will, sir, I most certainly will,”“Hope your business goes well,

Baron, I’ll not bother you.”“Brilliant, Harry!”“Well, there you are,”“Snape’s
already got past Fluffy.”“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,”“You can take the cloak, I won’t need it now.”“Don’t be stupid,”“We’re coming,”“What’s that at its feet?”“Looks like a harp,”“Snape must have left it
there.”“It must wake up the moment you stop playing,”“Well, here goes ...”“Keep playing,”“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,”“Want to go first,
Hermione?”“No, I don’t!”“All right.”“What can you see?”“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing
down, we’ll just have to drop.”“You want to go first? Are you sure?”“I
don’t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to
Hermione so she can keep him asleep.”“If anything happens to me, don’t
follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to
Dumbledore, right?”“Right,”“See you in a minute, I hope. ...”“It’s okay!”“it’s a
soft landing, you can jump!”“What’s this stuff?”“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here
to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!”“We must be miles under the school,”“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,”“Lucky”“Look at you both!”“Stop moving!”“I know what
this is — it’s Devil’s Snare!”“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a
great help,”“Shut up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!”“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!”“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare ... what did Professor
Sprout say? — it likes the dark and the damp — ”“So light a fire!”“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!”“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?”“ARE YOU A
WITCH OR NOT?”“Oh, right!”“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,”“Yeah,”“and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his
head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.”“This way,”“Can you hear something?”“Do you think it’s a ghost?”“I don’t know ... sounds like wings to me.”“There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.”“Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?”“Probably,”“They don’t look very vicious,
but I suppose if they all swooped down at once . . .
well, there’s no other choice ... I’ll run.”“Now what?”“These birds ... they can’t be here just for decoration,”“They’re not birds!”“They’re
keys Winged keys — look carefully. So that must
mean ...”“... yes —
look! Broomsticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the
door!”“But there are hundreds of them!”“We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably
silver, like the handle.”“That one!”“That big one —
there — no, there — with bright blue wings — the
feathers are all crumpled on one side.”“We’ve got to close in on it!”“Ron, you
come at it from above — Hermione, stay below and
stop it from going down — and I’ll try and catch it.
Right, NOW!”“Ready?”“Now what do we do?”“It’s obvious, isn’t it?”“We’ve got to play our
way across the room.”“How?”“I think,”“we’re going to have to be
chessmen.”“Do we — er — have to join you to get across?”“This needs thinking about. ...”“I suppose
we’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces.



Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron
think. Finally he said, “Now, don’t be offended or
anything, but neither of you are that good at chess —



“We’re not offended,”“Just tell us
what to do.”“Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and
Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.”“What about you?”“I’m going to be a knight,”“White always plays first in chess,”“Yes ... look ...”“Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right.”“Had to let that happen,”“Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go
on.”“We’re nearly there,”“Let me
think — let me think ...”“Yes ...”“it’s the only way ... I’ve got
to be taken.”“NO!”“That’s chess!”“You’ve got to make
some sacrifices! I make my move and she’ll take me —
that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!”“But — ”“Do you want to stop Snape or not?”“Ron — ”“Look, if you don’t hurry up, hell already have the
Stone!”“Ready?”“Here I go — now, don’t hang around once you’ve
won.”“What if he’s — ?”“He’ll be all right,”“What do you reckon’s next?”“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare;
Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall
transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that
leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s ...”“All right?”“Go on.”“I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,”“Come on, I can’t breathe.”“Snape’s,”“What do we have to do?”“Look!”“Brilliant,”“This isn’t magic — it’s
logic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t
got an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here forever.”“But so will we, won’t we?”“Of course not,”“Everything we need
is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison;
two are wine; one will get us safely through the black
fire, and one will get us back through the purple.”“But how do we know which to drink?”“Give me a minute.”“Got it,”“The smallest bottle will get us
through the black fire — toward the Stone.”“There’s only enough there for one of us,”“That’s hardly one swallow.”“Which one will get you back through the purple
flames?”“You drink that,”“No, listen, get back and
get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room,
they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy —
go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to
Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold
Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for him,
really.”“But Harry — what if You-Know- Who’s with him?”“Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?”“I might get lucky again.”“Hermionel”“Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.”“I’m not as good as you,”“Me!”“Books! And cleverness! There
are more important things — friendship and bravery
and — oh Harry — be carefull”“You drink first,”“You are sure which is
which, aren’t you?”“Positive,”“It’s not poison?”“No — but it’s like ice.”“Quick, go, before it wears off.”“Good luck — take care — ”“GO!”“Here I come,”“You”“Me,”“I wondered whether I’d be
meeting you here, Potter.”“But I thought — Snape — ”“Severus?”“Yes,
Severus does seem the type, doesn’t he? So useful to
have him swooping around like an overgrown bat.

Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-
stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?”“But Snape tried to kill me!”“No, no, no. / tried to kill you. Your friend Miss
Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed
to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She
broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds
and I’d have got you off that broom. I’d have managed
it before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a
countercurse, trying to save you.”“Snape was trying to save me?”“Of course,”“Why do you think
he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying
to make sure I didn’t do it again. Funny, really ... he
needn’t have bothered. I couldn’t do anything with
Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought
Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he
did make himself unpopular . . . and what a waste of
time, when after all that, I’m going to kill you tonight.”“You’re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the
school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you’d
seen me coming to look at what was guarding the
Stone.”“ You let the troll in?”“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must
have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back
there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was
running around looking for it, Snape, who already
suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head
me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat you to
death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to
bite Snape ’s leg off properly.








“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this
interesting mirror.”“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,”“Trust
Dumbledore to come up with something like this . . .
but he’s in London ... I’ll be far away by the time he
gets back. ...”“I saw you and Snape in the forest — ”“Yes,”“He was on to me by that time,
trying to find out how far I’d got. He suspected me all
along. Tried to frighten me — as though he could,
when I had Lord Voldemort on my side. ...”“I see the Stone ... I’m presenting it to my master ...
but where is it?”“But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.”“Oh, he does,”“heavens, yes.
He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you








know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted
you dead.”“But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought
Snape was threatening you.

For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across
Quirrell’s face.

“Sometimes,”“I find it hard to follow my
master’s instructions — he is a great wizard and I am
weak — ”“You mean he was there in the classroom with you?”“He is with me wherever I go,”“I
met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish
young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about
good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong
I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power,
and those too weak to seek it. ... Since then, I have
served him faithfully, although I have let him down
many times. He has had to be very hard on me.”“He does not forgive
mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone from
Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me
. . . decided he would have to keep a closer watch on
me. ...”“I don’t understand ... is the Stone inside the mirror?
Should I break it?”“What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help
me, Master!”“Use the boy ... Use the boy ...”“Yes — Potter — come here.”“Come here,”“Look in the mirror
and tell me what you see.”“Well?”“What do you see?”“I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,”“I — I’ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.”“Get out of the way,”“He lies ... He lies ...”“Potter, come back here!”“Tell me
the truth! What did you just see?”“Let me speak to him ... face-to-face. ...”“Master, you are not strong enough!”“I have strength enough ... for this. ...”“Harry Potter ...”“See what I have become?”“Mere
shadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can
share another’s body . . . but there have always been
those willing to let me into their hearts and minds. ...
Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks
. . . you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the
forest ... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be
able to create a body of my own. ... Now ... why don’t
you give me that Stone in your pocket?”“Don’t be a fool,”“Better save your
own life and join me ... or you’ll meet the same end as
your parents. ... They died begging me for mercy. ...”“LIAR!”“How touching ...”“I always value bravery.

... Yes, boy, your parents were brave. ... I killed your
father first, and he put up a courageous fight . . . but
your mother needn’t have died ... she was trying to
protect you. ... Now give me the Stone, unless you
want her to have died in vain.”“NEVER!”“SEIZE HIM!”“Seize him! SEIZE HIM!”“Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my
hands!”“Then kill him, fool, and be done!”“AAAARGH!”“KILL HIM! KILL HIM!”“Harry! Harry!”“Good afternoon, Harry,”“Sir! The
Stone! It was Quirrell! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick —



“Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the
times,”“Quirrell does not have the
Stone.”“Then who does? Sir, I — ”“Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me
thrown out.”“Tokens from your friends and admirers,”“What happened down in the
dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a
complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school
knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George
Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a
toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse
you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be
very hygienic, and confiscated it.”“How long have I been in here?”“Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger
will be most relieved you have come round, they have
been extremely worried.”“But sir, the Stone — ”“I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the
Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it








from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although
you were doing very well on your own, I must say.”“You got there? You got Hermione’s owl?”“We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I
reached London than it became clear to me that the
place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived
just in time to pull Quirrell off you — ”“It was you.”“I feared I might be too late.”“You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept him off the
Stone much longer — ”“Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly
killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid
it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.”“Destroyed?”“But your friend —
Nicolas Flamel — ”“Oh, you know about Nicolas?”“You did do the thing
properly, didn’t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a
little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.”“But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?”“They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in
order and then, yes, they will die.”“To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible,
but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to






bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-
organized mind, death is but the next great
adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a
wonderful thing. As much money and life as you
could want! The two things most human beings would
choose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a
knack of choosing precisely those things that are
worst for them.”“Sir?”“I’ve been thinking ... Sir — even if
the Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who — ”“Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper
name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the
thing itself.”“Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort’s going to try other ways of
coming back, isn’t he? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has
he?”“No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there
somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to
share ... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He
left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his
followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while
you may only have delayed his return to power, it will
merely take someone else who is prepared to fight
what seems a losing battle next time — and if he is
delayed again, and again, why, he may never return
to power.”“Sir, there are some
other things I’d like to know, if you can tell me ...
things I want to know the truth about. ...”“The truth.”“It is a beautiful and
terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with
great caution. However, I shall answer your questions
unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case
I beg you 11 forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.”“Well ... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother
because she tried to stop him from killing me. But
why would he want to kill me in the first place?”“Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you.

Not today. Not now. You will know, one day ... put it
from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older . . .
I know you hate to hear this . . . when you are ready,
you will know.”“But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me?”“Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing
Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn’t
realize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you
leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign ... to
have been loved so deeply, even though the person
who loved us is gone, will give us some protection
forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred,
greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort,
could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to
touch a person marked by something so good.”“And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know
who sent it to me?”“Ah — your father happened to leave it in my
possession, and I thought you might like it.”“Useful things ... your
father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens
to steal food when he was here.”“And there’s something else ...”“Fire away.”“Quirrell said Snape — ”“Professor Snape, Harry.”“Yes, him — Quirrell said he hates me because he
hated my father. Is that true?”“Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike
yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did
something Snape could never forgive.”“What?”“He saved his life.”“What?”“Yes ...”“Funny, the way
people’s minds work, isn’t it? Professor Snape
couldn’t bear being in your father’s debt. ... I do
believe he worked so hard to protect you this year
because he felt that would make him and your father
even. Then he could go back to hating your father’s
memory in peace. ...”“And sir, there’s one more thing ...”“Just the one?”“How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?”“Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that. It was one of
my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me,
that’s saying something. You see, only one who
wanted to find the Stone — find it, but not use it —
would be able to get it, otherwise they’d just see
themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My
brain surprises even me sometimes. ... Now, enough
questions. I suggest you make a start on these
sweets. Ah! Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans! I was
unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a
vomit-flavored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve
rather lost my liking for them — but I think I’ll be safe
with a nice toffee, don’t you?”“Alas! Ear wax!”“Just five minutes,”“Absolutely not.”“You let Professor Dumbledore in. ...”“Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite
different. You need rest.”“I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go
on, Madam Pomfrey ...”“Oh, very well,”“But five minutes only.”“Harryl”“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to —
Dumbledore was so worried — ”“The whole school’s talking about it,”“What
really happened?”“So the Stone’s gone?”“Flamel’s just
going to die?”“That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that —
what was it? — ‘to the well-organized mind, death is
but the next great adventure.’ ”“I always said he was off his rocker,”“So what happened to you two?”“Well, I got back all right,”“I brought
Ron round — that took a while — and we were
dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when
we met him in the entrance hall — he already knew —
he just said, ‘Harry’s gone after him, hasn’t he?’ and
hurtled off to the third floor.”“D’you think he meant you to do it?”“Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?”“Well,”“if he did — I mean to say
— that’s terrible — you could have been killed.”“No, it isn’t,”“He’s a funny
man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give
me a chance. I think he knows more or less
everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he
had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and
instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to
help. I don’t think it was an accident he let me find
out how the mirror worked. It’s almost like he thought
I had the right to face Voldemort if I could. ...”“Yeah, Dumbledore’s off his rocker, all right,”“Listen, you’ve got to be up for the end-
of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and
Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last
Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by
Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.”“You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,”“I want to go to the feast,”“I can, can’t
I?”“Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to
go,”“And you have another visitor.”“Oh, good,”“Who is it?”“It’s — all — my — ruddy — fault!”“I told the evil git how ter get past
Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn’t
know, an’ I told him! Yeh could’ve died! All fer a
dragon egg! I’ll never drink again! I should be chucked
out an’ made ter live as a Muggle!”“Hagrid!”“Hagrid, he’d have found out somehow,
this is Voldemort we’re talking about, he’d have found
out even if you hadn’t told him.”“Yeh could’ve died!”“An’ don’ say the
name!”“VOLDEMORT!”“I’ve met him and I’m
calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we
saved the Stone, it’s gone, he can’t use it. Have a
Chocolate Frog, I’ve got loads. ...”“That reminds me. I’ve got yeh a present.”“It’s not a stoat sandwich, is it?”“Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter
fix it. ’Course, he shoulda sacked me instead —
anyway, got y eh this ...”“Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends,
askin’ fer photos ... knew yeh didn’ have any ... d’yeh
like it?”“Another year gone!”“And I must trouble you with an old man’s wheezing
waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious
feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads
are all a little fuller than they were . . . you have the





whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty
before next year starts. ...

“Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs
awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place,
Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in
third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two;
Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and
Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.”“Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,”“However, recent events must be taken into account.”“Ahem,”“I have a few last-minute
points to dish out. Let me see. Yes ...

“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley ...”“... for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has
seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty
points.”“My brother, you
know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall’s
giant chess set!”“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of
cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House
fifty points.”“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter ...”“... for pure nerve and
outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty
points.”“There are all kinds of courage,”“It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up
to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our
friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville
Longbottom.”“Which means,”“we need a little
change of decoration.”“I always hope they’ll forget to give us





these,”“You must come and stay this summer,”“both of you — I’ll send you an owl.”“Thanks,”“I’ll need something to look
forward to.”“Bye, Harry!”“See you, Potter!”“Still famous,”“Not where I’m going, I promise you,”“There he is, Mom, there he is, look!”“Harry Potter!”“Look, Mom! I can see
“Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.”“Busy year?”“Very,”“Thanks for the fudge and the
sweater, Mrs. Weasley.”“Oh, it was nothing, dear.”“Ready, are you?”“You must be Harry’s family!”“In a manner of speaking,”“Hurry
up, boy, we haven’t got all day.”“See you over the summer, then.”“Hope you have — er — a good holiday,”“Oh, I will,”“ They don’t
know we’re not allowed to use magic at home. I’m
going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...”`
